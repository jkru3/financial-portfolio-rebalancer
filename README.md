# financial-portfolio-rebalancer
## trade-dashboard: flutter frontend
mobile application for desktop and mobile

TODO: Some features are buggy and needs some work to be integrated with auto-trader
## auto-trader: Cython backend (Python -> C++ for fast development and usage),
ingests stock data for the entire market and applies an EMA algorithm to forcast a prediction

TODO: integrate this so it works with a time-series ML model too
## time-series-forcast: Kubernetes and regressive model (TBD a learning project for me ðŸ˜‚)
this component will make the ML models that the auto-trader uses to make projections

no work has been started on this component yet
