# Need of iMoney

iMoney is developed in critique to trading apps like Robinhood. These application, along with many other investment apps, give people all the power to make trading decisions with their money. This is fine for some investors. However, it is also dangerous to new investors in particular. There are countless stories of investors losing everything on an emotionally charged options call or misplaced investment in undiversified stocks:

Similar to how Java is "safer" than C++ for programmers, we wanted to make a "safer" investment application. iMoney provides that safety, by making predictions on the projected growth of each stock available to users, and letting them pick which ones they want to add to their portfolio. Then, our iMoney provides users with a slider that allows them to redistribute whatever invested money is in their portfolio to the stocks projected to grow the most.
