The time and place where you conducted the audit:
2:53 pm May 28 2024

Describe the devices and device settings you used: 
Ran the application through a the VScode debugger on a mac

Describe what the app does well: 
The app has its basic functions and works functionally. There are no long delays and the majority of the app's widgets have a clear contrast making it obvious they are seperate. The add and edit views are very simple and the code has semantics making it very accesible for any impaired users who may rely on a screen reader. The dynamically changing adjustments based on the slider is also a very responsive and nice feature.

Describe what the app does poorly, and how it could be improved:
The commit button to make changes to the financial risk doesn't hold as much contrast as the other buttons, and the whole concept of how the slider affects your currently invested stocks is a bit unintuitive at first and may be hard for new users to understand. The UI isn't very clean and seems very messily put together, without much theme or style. Elements don't seem to have proper spacing making elements feel cramped and some small buttons are stuck together in the corner making it easy to potentially misclick.
