# Roadmap for Barebones Stock Price Speculation Platform
## Phase 1: Set Up the Kubernetes Environment
- [ ] Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster:
- [ ] Use a local cluster for development (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or K3s).
- [ ] Alternatively, use a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS) for production.
- [ ] Install Required Tools:
  - Install kubectl and helm for managing Kubernetes resources.
  - Set up a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) for storing Docker images.
- [ ] Deploy a Monitoring Stack:
  - Install Prometheus and Grafana using Helm for monitoring resource usage.
  - Example:
    - `helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus`
    - `helm install grafana grafana/grafana`
## Phase 2: Data Ingestion
- [x] Fetch Stock Price Data: Use a stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) to fetch historical and real-time data.
- [x] Write a Python script to fetch data and save it to a file (e.g., CSV).
- [ ] Containerize the Data Ingestion Script:
  - Create a Docker image for the data ingestion script.
- [ ] Deploy as a Kubernetes CronJob: Create a CronJob to run the data ingestion script periodically (e.g., every hour).

## Phase 3: Data Preprocessing
- [x] Preprocess Data: Write a Python script to clean and preprocess the stock price data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data).
- [ ] Save the preprocessed data to a shared storage (e.g., NFS, S3, or Kubernetes Persistent Volume).
- [ ] Containerize the Preprocessing Script:
- [ ] Create a Docker image for the preprocessing script.
- [ ] Deploy as a Kubernetes Job: Create a Job to run the preprocessing script after data ingestion.

## Phase 4: Model Training
- [ ] Train a Simple Model: Write a Python script to train a simple model (e.g., LSTM for time series prediction).
- [ ] Save the trained model to shared storage.
- [ ] Containerize the Training Script: Create a Docker image for the training script.
- [ ] Deploy as a Kubernetes Job:
- [ ] Create a Job to run the training script after data preprocessing.

## Phase 5: Model Deployment
- [ ] Serve the Model as a REST API:
- [ ] Write a Python script using Flask or FastAPI to serve the trained model as a REST API.
- [ ] Containerize the API: Create a Docker image for the API.
- [ ] Deploy as a Kubernetes Deployment: Create a Deployment to serve the API.
- [ ] Expose the API:
- [ ] Create a Service to expose the API.
- [ ] Example Service YAML:

## Phase 6: Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Resource Usage: Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor CPU, memory, and API performance.
- [ ] Set Up Alerts: Configure alerts for high resource usage or failed jobs.

## Phase 7: Testing and Iteration
- [ ] Test the Platform: Run end-to-end tests to ensure data ingestion, preprocessing, training, and deployment work as expected.
